webcharms
====================
A simple example of replicating the charms bar found in Windows 8 using jQuery animations and custom easing. Also has a handy close button for manual invocation or mobile use.

The jQuery & jQuery easing plugin are both served via CloudFlare's CDN.

For best results, this should be ran on a system with the Segoe UI [Semilight] font installed.

###Issues
* Only supports an odd number of menu items
* Queues up animations when opened multiple times
